        This event has been a long-time dream of mine— and i'm using my birthday
        to pilot it. It’s a (preferably sober) space for anyone who loves words,
        whether you want to share your own poetry, read someone else’s, or
        simply listen. No experience is needed—this is a place to put the words
        usually tucked away in your notes app. Bring your poems, favorite
        lyrics, or anything that speaks to you. A queer space where allies are
        more than welcome. No one is "too much" of a beginner, come as you are.
        Click on the invite to find out info.

        *Queering: reinterpreting, or expanding traditional norms,
        perspectives, or structures, often through the lens of LGBTQ+
        experiences or identities.
